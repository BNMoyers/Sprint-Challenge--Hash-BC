# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables and Blockchain

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we learned how hash tables combine two data structures to get the best of both worlds and were introduced into the fascinating world of blockchains. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by solving algorithms in Python using hash tables and add another key feature to your blockchain.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in related to hash tables and blockchains.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts:  Hash tables coding, blockchain coding, and a short interview covering parts of hash tables and blockchain.

## Interview Questions

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?

  -- simply accessing an array is constant, as is removing from the end or adding to the end of an array that is not yet full. But if you want to add to/remove from the front, or add to an already full array, your time becomes (worst case) linear. 

* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?

  -- technically, if you were only extending the storage size by a single spot, you'd have linear time. But because dynamic arrays adjust in larger chunks (such as doubling), the runtime is 'amortized' and considered constant.

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
 
blocks are objects which hold data - usually some type of transaction - as well as a time stamp, the previous block as a hashed string, and a proof. The prev hash and the proof respectively form the links of the chain, and the blocks go in order. 

Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?

The proof is the closest thing to a puzzle we can currently give a computer; it's easy to recognize as correct (usually because it has a certain number of trailing zeros or matching characters with the previous proof), yet it takes a long time for the computer to solve. 

Because each block is hashed when included in the next block, and hashes change entirely from a single character change in the block, it's impossible to change anything in the block without breaking the chain.

So to hack the chain, you'd have to manipulate the block's data AND the data of every single block after it through the end of the chain, BEFORE someone else finds the next block. 

Technically speaking, this kind of brute force attack is possible - but the probability of anyone getting that lucky is so small as to be statistically insignificant. 

## Project Set Up

#### [Hash Tables]

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

*You may not use any advanced, built-in Python functions to solve these problems.*

#### [Blockchain]

For the blockchain portion of the challenge, you will be writing code for a new miner that will solve a different Proof of Work algorithm than the one we have been working with.

Your goal is to mine at least one coin.  Keep in mind that with many people competing over the same coins, this may take a long time.  By our math, we expect that an average solution should be the first to find a solution at least once in an hour or two of mining.
